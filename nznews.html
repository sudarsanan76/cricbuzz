                  <p>A tenacious New Zealand lifted the inaugural World Test Championship title with a comfortable eight-wicket win over India on the sixth and final day of the marquee final in Southampton on Wednesday.

                    It is the first major ICC trophy for the Black Caps since 2000. They had ended runners-up at the 2019 ODI World Cup after losing the final to hosts England on boundary count. They had also lost the 2015 World Cup final to Australia. </p>
                 <br>
                 <p>The seasoned pair of skipper Kane Williamson (52) and Ross Taylor (47) took New Zealand past the finish line with their unbeaten 96-run partnership as they overhauled the 139-run target without much fuss.

              New Zealand’s only other ICC event triumphs have come in the 2000 Knockout Trophy (men’s) and 2000 ODI World Cup (women’s).</p>

                  <p>India began the sixth day 32 runs ahead, on 64/2, with Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara at the crease, and with all results still possible.

                    New Zealand knew that they needed a fair helping of wickets in the morning session, and Kyle Jamieson got them off to a superb start, tempting Kohli into a nibble that BJ Watling, playing in his final ever Test, gratefully grabbed behind the stumps.
                    
                    And the big Kiwi bowler struck again in his very next over, luring a rare waft out of Pujara to get the edge, with Ross Taylor taking a good catch in the cordon.
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        New Zealand’s two premier batters rode out the storm and gradually accelerated the scoring rate as the game progressed into the last hour of the reserve day.

And, after Williamson had reached his half-century (only the second of the match on either side), it fell to Taylor to hit the winning runs
