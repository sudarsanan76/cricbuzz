              <div class="col-6">
              <p>BCCI again is in an uncomfortable situation. The Indian board may have to name further replacements for Prithvi Shaw and Suryakumar Yadav, who were set to leave for the UK on July 30. After Covid-19 scare in the Indian camp in Sri Lanka both players currently are under isolation and can’t board flight to London anytime soon. Even as per the local protocols by the UK health authorities, they may not be given entry in England anytime soon.</p>
              <p>“We can’t say anything with certainty at this stage. We have to observe them for next couple of days to decide – whether to announce new replacements or not”, declared the BCCI official</p>

                  <p>Shaw and Suryakumar are currently in isolation in Colombo as close contacts of Krunal Pandya, who tested positive on Tuesday on the India tour of Sri Lanka.

                    The duo was named replacements after Shubman Gill and Washington Sundar suffered series-ending injuries. As per information available with InsideSport, the duo’s departure will be delayed as they will have to be in isolation for a minimum of 3 days and the duration may extend depending on the RTPCR test results over the next 3 days.
                    
                    It is worth noting that BCCI has already withdrawn both Shaw & Surya along with 6 other close contacts of Krunal Pandya from the ongoing series. The players are currently in complete isolation as a precautionary measure.</p>
